# Pythos

## Python developmental environment 
Pythos is a platform for creating developmental environments. Pythos is built on top of the branching-blockchain and IPFS. Pythos is still very much in development and needs work. Im working on getting all of the legacy code from the branching-blockchain module refactored, streamlined, and merged into the modules.
